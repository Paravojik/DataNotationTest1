## Introduction
Social networking sites are online platforms that allow people to connect, communicate, and share content with others worldwide. They have become an essential part of modern life, enabling users to exchange ideas, photos, and videos instantly. Popular examples include Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn, each serving unique social purposes.

These platforms provide a space for personal expression, community building, and professional networking. Users can join groups, follow pages, and engage in discussions about shared interests. Social networking sites also play a major role in shaping public opinion, promoting businesses, and raising awareness about important social, political, and environmental issues.

Despite their benefits, social networking sites also have drawbacks, such as privacy concerns, cyberbullying, and addiction. Excessive use can affect mental health and productivity. Therefore, it is important for users to balance online interactions with real-life relationships and use these platforms responsibly to create a safer digital environment.
